# almod
Script that helps configure Alacritty terminal.
It is strongly recommended to use the -b option before you use any other option or make a backup manually of your config file.

You can increase/decrase opacity and text size, download themes from "https://github.com/eendroroy/alacritty-theme/tree/master/themes" and then set a random one or choose the one you want with dmenu, you can also change the font with dmenu.
Don't forget to use the -b option to make a backup before you start using it (you can use -r option to restore it).
Use -h option for more details.
